# WatchTurm Control Room - Logo Design

## Design logic

The logo is a **stratified frame**: a square outline with two horizontal dividers, forming three equal bands. The mark is deliberately structural and architectural. The closed square suggests containment and boundary-what the control room observes stays within a defined scope. The horizontal tiers read as layers or levels (environments, stages, tiers) without literally depicting pipelines or workflows. The result is abstract, geometric, and systemic. It reads as “structure” and “stability,” not “motion” or “magic.”

The symbol uses only three elements (one frame, two lines), flat stroke, no gradients or effects. It holds up at favicon size and works in both light and dark variants. The wordmark pairs a clean, medium-weight sans-serif (“WatchTurm”) with a smaller, slightly muted “Control Room” line-clear hierarchy, calm tone, no decorative tricks. Typography is set in a system-style sans stack for reliability and an enterprise-appropriate feel.

## Why it fits this product

WatchTurm Control Room is a read-only observability and traceability platform for engineering leaders, release managers, and DevOps. It is built on infra-as-truth, deterministic snapshots, and explicit “unknown” states. The logo reflects that: controlled, ordered, and grounded in structure rather than metaphor. It avoids CI/CD clichés (arrows, pipelines, rockets), generic “insights” (charts, heartbeats), and anything playful or consumer-focused. The stratified frame reads as “mission-critical internal platform” and “we observe structure, we don’t invent it”-aligned with how the product is positioned and sold.
